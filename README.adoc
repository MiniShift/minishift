Minishift is a tool that helps you run OpenShift locally by running a
single-node OpenShift cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or
develop with it, day-to-day, on your local host.

Minishift uses https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine[libmachine] for
provisioning VMs, and https://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift Origin] for running the cluster.
