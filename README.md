# Minishift

Minishift is a tool that helps you to run OpenShift locally by running a single-node OpenShift
cluster inside a VM. You can try out OpenShift or develop with it day-to-day on your local host.

Minishift uses [libmachine](https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine) for
provisioning VMs, and [OpenShift Origin](https://github.com/openshift/origin) for running the cluster.

## Installation

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

Minishift requires a hypervisor to run the virtual machine containing OpenShift. Depending on your
host OS, you have the following choices:

* OS X
    * [xhyve driver](./docs/docker-machine-drivers.md#xhyve-driver), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion) installation
* Linux
    * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/) installation
* Windows
    * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt169373.aspx) installation

The driver can be selected via the `--vm-driver=xxx` flag of `minishift start`. See
[docker machine drivers](./docs/docker-machine-drivers.md) for more details on supported drivers
and how to install them.

**Note**: For most hyervisor VT-x/AMD-v virtualization must be enabled in BIOS. For Hyper-V, however,
it needs to be disabled.

### Instructions

Download the binary matching your host OS from the Minishift [releases page](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases) and copy it to your preferred location. Make sure it is executable and optionally rename
it to _minishift_.

On OS X you can also use [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) to install Minishift:

  ```
  $ brew cask install minishift
  ```

## Quickstart

This section contains a brief demo of Minishift usage.

<a name="starting-minishift"></a>
### Starting Minishift

Note that the IP below is dynamic and can change. It can be retrieved with `minishift ip`.

```shell
$ minishift start
Starting local OpenShift cluster...
...
   OpenShift server started.
   The server is accessible via web console at:
       https://192.168.99.128:8443

   You are logged in as:
       User:     developer
       Password: developer

   To login as administrator:
       oc login -u system:admin

# Adding 'oc' to the PATH (Note, concrete version might be different)
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.minishift/cache/oc/v1.3.1

# Authenticate against OpenShift
$ oc login https://192.168.99.128:8443 -u developer -p developer

# Create Node.js example app
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex -l name=myapp

# Tail the built log until the app is build and deployed
$ oc logs -f bc/nodejs-ex

# Expose a route to the service
oc expose svc/nodejs-ex

# Access the app
$ curl http://nodejs-ex-myproject.192.168.99.128.xip.io

$ minishift stop
Stopping local OpenShift cluster...
Stopping "minishift"...
```
<a name="reusing-the-docker-daemon"></a>
### Reusing the Docker daemon

When running OpenShift in a single VM, it's recommended to reuse the Docker daemon Minishift uses
for pure Docker use-cases as well.
You can use the same docker daemon as Minishift, which speeds up local experiments.

To be able to work with the docker daemon on your Mac/Linux host use the
[docker-env command](./docs/minishift_docker-env.md) in your shell:

```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```

You should now be able to use _docker_ on the command line of your host talking to the docker daemon
inside the minishift VM:
```
docker ps
```
