[[vision]]
== Vision

*Run OpenShift locally.*

Minishift's goal is to become the default choice for running a
single-node OpenShift cluster on your local host. Either for evaluation
purposes or for ongoing development.

Due to the fact that Minishift builds on OpenShift
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/release-3.11/docs/cluster_up_down.md[cluster up],
Minishift's focus lies on providing more value to the basic
_cluster up_ provisioning. This includes virtual machine creation and
management, making it easier to configure OpenShift in precisely the way
you want and providing useful shortcut commands for making your work
easier.

[[issue-tracking]]
== Issue tracking

The Minishift team currently uses the GitHub
https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues[issue tracker] to plan its
work. Issues are generally categorized into __tasks__, _bugs_ and
__features__. Looking at the latter,
__https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Akind%2Ffeature[features]__,
is probably the best way to get an overview where Minishift is heading.

[[upcoming-versions]]
== Upcoming versions

The following sections give a high level overview of the envisioned
features and how they fit into upcoming releases. Of course this is
subject to change and actual version names might change as well, because
http://semver.org/[semantic versioning] is used to determine the final
version name of a given release.
