Minishift uses several CI build servers, including https://ci.centos.org/[CentOS CI]. The server
builds incoming pull requests and pushes to master. It also archives build artifacts of successful
builds.

You can find the CentOS CI Jenkins job for Minishift https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift/[here].

The artifacts of a successful pull request build can be found at
http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/pr/[artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/pr/<PRID>].

Artifacts of a successful master build can be found at
http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/master/[artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/master/<BUILDID>].

For more information about CentOS CI, see the https://wiki.centos.org/QaWiki/CI[CentOS CI] documentation.
