[[developing-overview]]
== Overview

The following sections describe how to build and test {project}.

[[develop-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

- Git
- A recent Go distribution (>=1.8)

[NOTE]
====
You should be able to develop {project} on Linux, macOS or Windows.
The Windows operating system might require additional steps or have some limitations.
====

[[set-up-dev-env]]
== Setting Up the Development Environment

[[create-go-workspace]]
=== Creating the Go Workspace

We highly recommend to setup a default Go link:https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces[workspace].
Even though it might require an adjustment in your work processes, the goal is to have a single workspace for all Go development.

. Create the following directories in the base directory you want to use, such as *_$HOME/work_*:
+
/bin::
Contains executable commands

/pkg::
Contains package objects

/src::
Contains Go source files

. Add the path of the root workspace directory to the `GOPATH` environment variable.
For example:
+
----
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work
----

. Add the workspace *_bin_* directory to the `PATH` environment variable:
+
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
----

[NOTE]
====
On Windows operating systems, you use the UI or a shell-specific approach to set environment variables.

For Command Prompt, see link:https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754250.aspx[`set`] and link:https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755104.aspx[`setx`].

For PowerShell, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables[About Environment Variables].
====

[[cloning-repository]]
=== Cloning the Repository

Get the {project} sources from GitHub:

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src
$ git clone https://github.com/minishift/minishift.git github.com/minishift/minishift
----

[[using-ide]]
=== Using an IDE

You can use any editor you want.
However, most of the core maintainers of {project} use IntelliJ link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IDEA] with the latest Go plug-in.
This IDE indexes your whole workspace and allows for easy navigation of the sources, and also integrates with the Go debugger link:https://github.com/derekparker/delve[Delve].

For instructions on setting up IDEA, see link:http://hadihariri.com/2015/09/30/setting-up-go-on-intellij/[Setting up Go on IntelliJ].

[[manage-dependencies]]
== Dependency Management

{project} uses link:https://github.com/Masterminds/glide[Glide] for dependency management.

[[install-glide]]
=== Installing Glide

Before you can use Glide you need to download and install it from GitHub:

----
$ go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
----

This will install the `glide` binary into *_$GOPATH/bin_*.
Make sure to use Glide version 0.12.3 or later.

[[bootstrap-dependencies]]
=== Bootstrapping Dependencies

After a clean checkout or after a `make clean`, there won't be a *_vendor_* directory containing the needed {project} dependencies.

To install the dependencies, you can run the following command:

----
$ make vendor
----

This command calls and runs Glide.
Alternatively, you can run the Glide command directly.

----
$ glide install -v
----

[[update-dependencies]]
=== Updating Dependencies

If your work requires a change to the dependencies, you need to update the Glide configuration.

. Edit *_glide.yaml_* to change the dependencies as needed.

. Delete *_glide.lock_* and re-create the vendor directory by running `make vendor`.
Glide will recognize that there is no lock file and recalculate the required dependencies.

. Check-in the updated *_glide.yaml_* and *_glide.lock_* files.

. Test that everything still compiles with the new lock file in place by running `make clean && make`.

[TIP]
====
The Glide cache located under *_~/.glide/cache_* can get corrupted in some cases.
If you see Glide errors during `make vendor`, you can clear the Glide cache via `glide cc`.
====

[[build-minishift]]
== Building {project}

[[build-minishift-binary]]
=== Building the minishift Binary

Run the following command to create a platform-specific binary and copy it to *_$GOPATH/bin_*.

----
$ make
----

[NOTE]
====
Use `make cross` to cross-compile for other platforms.
====

[[run-minishift-binary]]
=== Running the minishift Binary

Start the OpenShift cluster with your built `minishift` binary:

----
$ minishift start
----

This command will run {project} from *_$GOPATH/bin/minishift_*, if you set up your Go workspace as described in the xref:create-go-workspace[Creating the Go workspace] section.

You can also execute the binaries directly from the *_out_* directory of the checkout.
Depending on your operating system, the binary is in one of the following directories:

* *_out/darwin-amd64_*
* *_out/linux-amd64_*
* *_out/windows-amd64_*

For more {project} commands and flags, see the xref:../command-ref/minishift.adoc#[{project} command reference] documentation.

[[unit-tests]]
=== Unit Tests

Unit tests run on *Travis* before the code is merged.
To run tests during the development cycle:

----
$ make test
----

To run specific tests, use one of the following methods:

- Run all tests on a single package.
+
----
# Eg: go test -v ./cmd/minikube/cmd
$ go test -v <relative path of package>
----
- Run a single test on a single package.
+
----
$ go test -v <relative path of package> -run <Testcase Name>
----
- Run tests that match a pattern.
+
----
$go test -v <relative path of package> -run "Test<Regex pattern to match tests>"
----

For more information about test options, run the `go test --help` command and review the documentation.

[[integration-tests]]
=== Integration Tests

Integration tests utilize link:https://github.com/DATA-DOG/godog[Godog], which uses Gherkin (Cucumber) to define sets of test cases.
These test cases are known as _features_ in Gherkin terminology.
Features are located in the *_test/integration/features_* directory.
Features for {project} follow these basic concepts:

User stories::
Features which follow a happy path of user.
For example, *basic.feature* or *coolstore.feature*.

Feature and command coverage::
Features which focuses on specific fields of {project} functionality or individual commands.
For example, *proxy.feature* or *cmd-version.feature*.

[[running-integration-tests]]
==== Running Integration Tests

By default, tests are run against the binary created by `make build` (*_$GOPATH/bin/minishift_*).
To run the basic test, use the following command:

----
$ make integration
----

[NOTE]
====
`make integration` only runs tests which are tagged as `@basic` by default.
====

To run all of the tests, use the following command:

----
$ make integration_all
----

[NOTE]
====
There is also a `make integration_pr` target which is being run as part of pull request testing.
====

===== Additional Parameters

The default targets `integration` and `integration_all` can be further customized using several parameters to provide more flexibility.

MINISHIFT_BINARY::
The `MINISHIFT_BINARY` parameter can be used to run integration tests against a `minishift` binary located in a different directory:

----
$ make integration MINISHIFT_BINARY=<path-to-custom-binary>
----

TIMEOUT::
The `TIMEOUT` parameter can be used to override the default timeout of `3600s`.
To run all the tests with a timeout of `7200s`, use the following command:

----
$ make integration_all TIMEOUT=7200s
----

RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE::
The `RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE` parameter specifies {project} commands to be run before each feature.
This provides the ability to run integration tests against a {project} instance which is not in its default state.
When multiple commands are specified, they must be delimited by a semicolon.
For example, tests can be run against a stopped {project} instance with the image caching option turned on by running the following:

----
$ make integration_all RUN_BEFORE_FEATURE="start; stop; config set image-caching true"
----

[[godog-options]]
==== Using the GODOG_OPTS Parameter

The `GODOG_OPTS` parameter specifies additional arguments for the Godog runner.
The following options are available:

Tags::
Use `tags` to ensure that scenarios and features containing at least one of the selected tags are executed.

Paths::
Use `paths` to define paths to different feature files or folders containing feature files.
This can be used to run feature files outside of the *_test/integration/features_* folder.

Format::
Use `format` to change the format of Godog's output.
For example, you can set the format to `progress` instead of the default `pretty`.

Stop-on-failure::
Set `stop-on-failure` to `true` to stop integration tests on failure.

No-colors::
Set `no-colors` to `true` to disable ANSI colorization of Godog's output.

Definitions::
Set `definitions` to `true` to print all available step definitions.

[NOTE]
====
Passing any value via `GODOG_OPTS` overrides the default tag definition on each integration target.
Thus in this case `--tags` must be specified manually, otherwise all features will be run.
====

For example, to run integration tests on two specific feature files using only `@basic` and `@openshift` tags and without ANSI colors, the following command can be used:

----
$ make integration GODOG_OPTS="-paths ~/tests/custom.feature,~/my.feature -tags basic,openshift -no-colors true"
----

[NOTE]
====
Multiple values for a `GODOG_OPTS` option must be separated by a comma without whitespace.
For example, `-tags basic,openshift` will be parsed properly by `make`, whereas `-tags basic, openshift` will result in only `@basic` being used.
====

==== Viewing Results

The integration test logs its progress directly into a console.
This information is often enough to find and debug the reason for a failure.

However, for cases which require further investigation, the integration test also logs more detailed progress into a log file.
This file is located at *_$GOPATH/github.com/minishift/minishift/out/test-results/integration_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.log_*.

[[format-source-code]]
=== Formatting the Source Code

{project} adheres to the Go link:https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting[formatting guidelines].
Code with incorrect formatting will fail the CI builds.
You can check whether any of your files violate the guidelines with the following command:

----
$ make fmtcheck
----

You can correct the formatting errors yourself or instruct the violations to be corrected automatically with the following command:

----
$ make fmt
----

You can also check for common coding mistakes by using:

----
$ make vet
----

Similar to `make fmtcheck`, failures in `make vet` will fail the CI builds.

[[commit-message-requirements]]
=== Commit Message Requirements

Each commit message must meet two requirements:

* the commit subject is strictly less than 90 characters (GitHub ellipsis length).
* the commit subject matches the format `Issue #[0-9]+ .*`, meaning each commit must reference an issue.

The Makefile contains a `validate_commits` target which can be used to verify these requirements:

----
$ make validate_commits
----

[[clean-workspace]]
=== Cleaning the Workspace

To remove all generated artifacts and installed dependencies, run the following command:

----
$ make clean
----

[[godoc]]
== Godoc

When developing {project}, it is encouraged to use link:https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc[Godoc] to document the source code.
You can find guidelines on how to use Godoc in link:https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code[this blog post].
You can browse the {project} Godoc documentation under link:https://godoc.org/github.com/minishift/minishift[https://godoc.org/github.com/minishift/minishift].
