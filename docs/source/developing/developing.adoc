[[developing-overview]]
== Overview

The following sections describe how to build and test Minishift.

[[develop-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

- Git
- A recent Go distribution (>1.7)

NOTE: You should be able to develop on Minishift on any operating system, such as GNU/Linux,
Mac OS X or Windows. The Windows operating system might require additional steps or
have some limitations.

[[set-up-dev-env]]
== Setting up the development environment

[[create-go-workspace]]
=== Creating the Go workspace

We highly recommend to setup a default Go https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces[workspace].
Even though it might require an adjustment in your work processes, the goal is to have a single
workspace for all Go development.

. Create the following directories in the base directory you want to use, such as _$HOME/work_:
+
/bin::
Contains executable commands

/pkg::
Contains package objects

/src::
Contains Go source files

. Add the path to the root workspacce directory to the _GOPATH_ environment
variable. For example:
+
----
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work
----

. Add the workspace _bin_ directory to the _PATH_ environment variable:
+
----
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
----

NOTE: On Windows operating systems, you use the UI or use _setx_ to set the environment variables.

[[cloning-repository]]
=== Cloning the repository

Get the Minishift sources from GitHub.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src
$ git clone https://github.com/minishift/minishift.git github.com/minishift/minishift
----

[[using-ide]]
=== Using an IDE

You can use any editor you want. However, most of the core maintainers of Minishift use Intellij
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IDEA] with the latest Go plugin. This IDE indexes your
whole workspace and allows for easy navigation of the sources, and also integrates
with the Go debugger https://github.com/derekparker/delve[Delve].

For instructions on setting up IDEA, see http://hadihariri.com/2015/09/30/setting-up-go-on-intellij/[Setting up Go on IntelliJ].

[[manage-dependencies]]
== Dependency management

Minishift uses https://github.com/Masterminds/glide[Glide] for dependency management.

[[install-glide]]
=== Installing Glide

Before you can use Glide you need to download and install it from GitHub:

----
$ go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
----

This will install the _glide_ binary into _$GOPATH/bin_. Make sure to use Glide version _0.12.3_ or later.

[[bootstrap-dependencies]]
=== Bootstrapping dependencies

After a clean checkout or after a `make clean`, there won't be a _vendor_ directory
containing the needed Minishift dependencies.

To install the dependencies, you can run the following command:

----
$ make vendor
----

This command calls and runs Glide. Alternatively, you can run the Glide command directly.

----
$ glide install -v
----

[NOTE]
====
On Windows you might encounter errors because some of the dependency path names are too long.
Workaround: Use a non-default `tmp` directory for Glide to shorten the path length.

----
$ mkdir c:\tmp
$ glide --tmp C:\tmp install -v
----
====

[[update-dependencies]]
=== Updating dependencies

If your work requires a change to the dependencies, you need to incorporate the updated
information to the Glide files.

. Edit the _glide.yaml_ file to change the dependency list as needed.

. Delete the _glide.lock_ file and re-create the vendor directory by link:#bootstrapping-dependencies[bootstrapping] it. Glide will recognize
that there is no lock file and recalculate the required dependencies.

. Check-in the updated _glide.lock_ file and the updated _glide.yaml_.

. Test that everything still compiles with the new lock file in place.

[[build-minishift]]
== Building Minishift

[[build-minishift-binary]]
=== Building the Minishift binary

Run the following command to create a platform-specific binary and copy it
to _$GOPATH/bin_.

----
$ make
----

NOTE: Use `make cross` to cross-compile for other platforms.

[[run-minishift-binary]]
=== Running the Minishift binary

Start the OpenShift cluster with your built minishift binary:

----
$ minishift start
----

This command will run Minishift from _$GOPATH/bin/minishift_, if you set up your Go
workspace as described in the link:#creating-the-go-workspace[Creating the Go workspace] section.

You can also execute the binaries directly from the _out_ directory of
the checkout. Depending on your operating system, the binary is in one of the following
directories:

* _out/darwin-amd64_
* _out/linux-amd64_
* _out/windows-amd64_

For more minishift commands and flags, see the link:../command-ref/minishift{outfilesuffix}[Minishift command reference] documentation.

[[testing-minishift]]
=== Testing Minishift

[[unit-tests]]
==== Unit Tests

Unit tests run on Travis before code is merged. To run tests during the development cycle:

----
$ make test
----

To run specific tests, use one of the following methods:

- Run all tests on a single package.
+
----
# Eg: go test -v ./cmd/minikube/cmd
$ go test -v <relative path of package>
----
- Run a single test on a single package.
+
----
$ go test -v <relative path of package> -run <Testcase Name>
----
- Run tests that match a pattern.
+
----
$go test -v <relative path of package> -run "Test<Regex pattern to match tests>"
----

For more information about test options, run the `go test --help` command and review the documentation.

[[integration-tests]]
==== Integration Tests

Integration tests utilize https://github.com/DATA-DOG/godog[`godog`], which uses Gherkin (Cucumber)
to define test cases. The test cases are defined in `test/integration/*.feature`.
Per default the tests are executed against the binary created by `make build`. This means
`$GOPATH/bin/minishift`. To run the tests, run:

----
$ make integration
----

To run integration tests against a Minishift binary in different location you can use the
`MINISHIFT_BINARY` argument:

----
$ make integration MINISHIFT_BINARY=<path-to-custom-binary>
----

Additional properties for Godog runner can be specified with `GODOG_OPTS` argument. Following options are available:

- `tags`: when used only scenarios and features containing at least one of selected tags will be executed.
- `paths`: defines paths to different feature files or folders containing feature files. This can be used to run feature files
outside of `test/integration/features` folder.
- `format`:  you can change format of Godog's output, for example you can use `pretty` format instead of native `progress`.
- `stop-on-failure`: set to true to stop integration tests on failure.
- `no-colors`: set to true to disable ansi colors of Godog's output.
- `definitions`: set to true to print all available step definitions.

For example to run integration tests on two specific feature files, using only `@basic` and `@openshift` tags and without ansi colors,
following command can be used:

----
$ make integration GODOG_OPTS="-paths ~/tests/custom.feature,~/my.feature -tags basic,openshift -no-colors true"
----

NOTE: When multiple values are used for options in GODOG_OPTS, then those have to be separated with
comma without a whitespace.
While `-tags basic,openshift` will be parsed properly by make, whereas `-tags basic, openshift` will
result in only `@basic` being used.

[[format-source]]
=== Formatting the source

Minishift adheres to the Go formatting https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting[guidelines].
Code with incorrect formatting will fail the the CI builds. You can check whether any of your
files violate the guidelines with the following command:

----
$ make fmtcheck
----

You can correct the formatting errors yourself ot instruct the violations to be corrected automatically
with the following command:

----
$ make fmt
----

[[clean-workspace]]
=== Cleaning the workspace

To remove all generated artifacts and installed dependencies, run the following command:

----
$ make clean
----
