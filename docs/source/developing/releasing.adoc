[[releasing-overview]]
== Overview

The following sections describe how to release Minishift.

[[release-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

* You must have a https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use[GitHub personal access token]
defined in your environment as _GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_.
* You need _gnutar_ installed on your machine. See also GitHub issue link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/657[#657].

== Preparing the GitHub milestone

. Verify the milestone you want to release
 * Move remaining open issues into the next milestone
 * Review resolved/closed issues and make sure they are classified correctly
 * Check and update the resolution of the issues. For example, issues with a merged pull
   requests should be labeled as _resolution/done_
. Close milestone

[[cut-release]]
== Cutting the release

. Bump the Minishift version in the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/Makefile[Makefile]

. Commit and push your changes with a message of the form "cut v1.0.0"

. Create binaries and upload them to GitHub (this will also tag the release):
+
----
$ make release
----

. Trigger documentation build.
This will build link:http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/minishift/minishift/docs/latest/[minishift-adoc.tar] which is in turn consumed by docs.openshift.org.
See also <<writing-docs#section-building-openshift-docs,Building OpenShift documentation>>.
+
----
$ export API_KEY=<api-key>
$ curl -H "$(curl --user minishift:$API_KEY 'https://ci.centos.org//crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)')" -X POST https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift-docs/build --user "minishift:$API_KEY"
----

== Post release

As part of the release process we also send a release announcement and edit the GitHub
release page.

For the latter we usually add a categorized list of closed issues as well as some
release highlights (most often taken from the release announcement).

If you have the link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] installed on your machine, you
can use the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/scripts/release/issue-list.sh[issue-list.sh] script to generate the markdown needed for adding the
issue list, for example:

----
$ cd scripts/release
$ ./issue-list.sh -r minishift -m 9
----
