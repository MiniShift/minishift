[[writing-docs-overview]]
== Overview

Minishift documentation is located in the _docs_ sub-folder of the repository.
The documentation is a mix of generated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] files and manually maintained https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[Asciidoc] files.

[[contribute-to-docs]]
== Contributing to the documentation

Minishift is an open-source project and we welcome contributions. Similar to code
contributions, if you want to add or edit Minishift documentation, you can create an
issue in our link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues[Github issue tracker] and
submit a pull request with the changes.

[[docs-conventions-guidelines]]
== Conventions and guidelines

Minishift documentation is authored in the link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[AsciiDoc] markup format. Since Minishift is closely related to the OpenShift Origin
project, we follow the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc[OpenShift Documentation Guidelines]
for tagging, formatting, and structure wherever possible.

The documentation source structure follows a modular format, where each file is called
a _topic_ and each topic is stored under a sub-folder based on the relevant category, such as
getting started, using Minishift, or command reference.

TIP: You can check out the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minishift/minishift/master/docs/source/developing/writing-docs.adoc[raw file]
of this topic or other existing Minishift topics to see examples of how the information is structured and which tags to use.

[[common-conventions]]
=== Commonly-used conventions

- Each file must contain a topic metadata header with a top-level heading followed by required AsciiDoc variable declarations. See
the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#topic-metadata[topic metadata]
section in the OpenShift documentation guidelines for more information.

- Links to another location within an AsciiDoc document or between AsciiDoc documents are called cross references and should use the _xref_ notation. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#internal-cross-references[internal cross-references]
section of the OpenShift documentation guidelines for more information and examples.

- Each section heading must be preceded by a unique anchor ID, to help make sure that
cross-references resolve to the correct section. The anchor ID text should match the title
as much as possible. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#unique-ids[unique IDs]
section of the OpenShift documentation guidelines for more information and examples.

[[adding-new-topic]]
=== Adding a new topic

If you are adding a new topic to the documentation library, you must also
update the navigation in the following ways:

- Add an entry to the relevant _index.adoc_ file for that topic. For example, if you
add a new topic in the _docs/source/using/_ directory, you must update the _docs/source/using/index.adoc_
file in the same directory.

- Add an entry to the __topic_map.yml_ in the _docs/source_ sub-folder. The entry must
contain the topic title and the file name.

Make sure to add the new topic in the same order in all of the locations.

[[building-docs]]
== Building the documentation

By default, the documentation is built in a Docker container. This way
you avoid having to install all the required dependencies on your
development machine. All you need is a running Docker daemon. In case
you don't have one, use Minishift itself. For more information, refer to
xref:../using/docker-daemon.adoc#reusing-docker-daemon[reusing the Docker daemon].

To generate the documentation into the directory _docs/build_, run:

----
$ make gen_docs
----

[NOTE]
====
Your local checkout of the sources are going to be mounted into the container in order to built the docs.
Depending on your UID on the host, you might see file permissions problems when trying to run _gen_docs_.
This is caused by the fact, that the _docs_ user used within the container uses per default a UID of 1000.
This might conflict with the user id of the mounted docs sources.
Your output might look like:
----
$ make gen_docs
mkdir -p build
rake aborted!
Errno::EACCES: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - build
----

In this case you need to build the container with a different user id.
This will ensure that the _docs_ user in the container will be able to create files and directories.

----
$ make build_docs_container IMAGE_UID=$(id -u)
----
====

To build and serve the documentation for editing, run:

----
$ make serve_docs
----

The `make serve_docs` command serves the documentation. You can access it by browsing to _http://<IP-of-Docker-daemon>:4567_.

If you encounter issues with the local staging of the documentation, you can run the following
command to remove all build artefacts:

----
$ make clean_docs
----

[[integration-with-docs-openshift-org]]
== Integration with docs.openshift.org

The Minishift documentation is deployed on _docs.openshift.org_ under
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift[https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift].

To integrate with the _docs.openshift.org_ we deliver a tarball containing the Minishift AsciiDoc files as well as some link:http://www.asciibinder.org/[AsciiBinder] meta data.
This tarball is generated via a Jenkins job on link:https://ci.centos.org/job/minishift-docs[CentOS CI] and triggered as part of a xref:./releasing.adoc#cut-release[release].

You can also build this tarball locally using:

----
$ make gen_adoc_tar
----

After the build completes there will be a _minishift-adoc.tar_ file in the _docs/build_ directory of your local repository.

[[building-openshift-docs]]
=== Building OpenShift documentation

In order to view the Minishift documentation integrated into the OpenShift documentation you can follow the following steps.

[NOTE]
====
Before you start, you need to check out the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs.git[openshift-docs] GitHub repository.
You need all the tooling to build openshift-docs.
See the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/tools_and_setup.adoc[Install and set up the tools and software] section, which is part of the _openshift-docs_ repository.
Make sure `rake build` succeeds before integrating the Minishift documentation.
====

First you need to build the Minishift documentation tarball from within the Minishift checkout:

----
$ make gen_adoc_tar
----

Once you have the tarball generated execute the following commands from witin the openshift-docs checkout:

----
$ mkdir minishift
$ cd minishift
$ cp <path to tarball> .
$ tar -xvf minishift-adoc.tar --strip 1
$ cat _topic_map.yml >> ../_topic_map.yml
$ cd ..
$ rake build
----

If the build completes successfully, the site is available under _preview/openshift-origin/latest/welcome/index.html_.
