[[writing-docs-overview]]
== Overview

Minishift documentation is located in the `docs` sub-folder.
The documentation is a mix of generated https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] files and manually maintained https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[Asciidoc] files.

[[contribute-to-docs]]
== Contributing to the documentation

Minishift is an open-source project and we welcome contributions. Similar to code
contributions, if you want to add or edit Minishift documentation, you can create an
issue in our link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues[Github issue tracker] and
submit a pull request with the changes.

[[docs-conventions-guidelines]]
== Conventions and guidelines

Minishift documentation is authored in the AsciiDoc markup format. Since Minishift is closely related to the OpenShift Origin
project, we follow the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc[OpenShift Documentation Guidelines]
for tagging, formatting, and structure wherever possible.

The documentation source structure follows a modular format, where each file is called
a _topic_ and each topic is stored under a sub-folder based on the relevant category, such as
getting started, using Minishift, or command reference.

TIP: You can check out the link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift/blob/master/docs/source/developing/writing-docs.adoc[raw file]
of this topic or other existing Minishift topics to see examples of how the information is structured and which tags to use.

[[common-conventions]]
=== Commonly-used conventions

- Each file must contain a topic metadata header with a top-level heading followed by required AsciiDoc variable declarations.
The only exception to this is the command reference topics, which are automatically generated and do not require this header.
You can view the raw file of this topic to see an example. Also, see
the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#topic-metadata[topic metadata]
section in the OpenShift documentation guidelines for more information.

- Whenever you link to internal documentation topics, you should use relative links that can
be resolved during the publication workflow instead of hard-coding URLs. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#internal-cross-references[internal cross-references]
section of the OpenShift documentation guidelines for more information and examples.

- Each section heading must be preceded by a unique anchor ID, to help make sure that
cross-references resolve to the correct section. The anchor ID text should match the title
as much as possible and it does not need to include the prefix _section_ or _topic_. See the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/doc_guidelines.adoc#unique-ids[unique IDs]
section of the OpenShift documentation guidelines for more information and examples.

[[adding-new-topic]]
=== Adding a new topic

If you are adding a new topic, or file, to the documentation library, you must also
update the navigation in the following ways:

- Add an entry to the relevant *_index.adoc_* file for that topic. For example, if you
add a new topic in the *_docs/source/using/_* directory, you must update the *_docs/source/using/index.adoc_*
file in the same directory.

- Add an entry to the *__topic_map.yml_* in the *_docs/source_* sub-folder. The entry must
contain the topic title and the file name.

Make sure to add the new topic in the same order in all of the locations.

[[building-docs]]
== Building the documentation

Minishift documentation is located in the *_docs_* sub-folder. The
documentation is a mix of generated
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] files and manually
maintained https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[Asciidoc] files.

By default, the documentation is built in a Docker container. This way
you avoid having to install all the required dependencies on your
development machine. All you need is a running Docker daemon. In case
you don't have one, use Minishift itself. For more information, see the
link:../command-ref/minishift_docker-env{outfilesuffix}[`minishift docker-env`] command.

To build the Docker image, run:

----
$ make build_docs_container
----

To generate the documentation into the directory *_docs/build_*, run:

----
$ make gen_docs
----

[NOTE]
====
Your local checkout of the sources are going to be mounted into the container in order to built the docs.
Depending on your UID on the host, you might see file permissions problems when trying to run _gen_docs_.
This is caused by the fact, that the _docs_ user used within the container uses per default a UID of 1000.
This might conflict with the user id of the mounted docs sources.
Your output might look like:
----
$ make gen_docs
mkdir -p build
rake aborted!
Errno::EACCES: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - build
----

In this case you need to build the container with a different user id.
This will ensure that the _docs_ user in the container will be able to create files and directories.

----
$ make build_docs_container IMAGE_UID=$(id -u)
----
====

To build and serve the documentation for editing, run:

----
$ make serve_docs
----

The `make serve_docs` command starts the link:https://middlemanapp.com[Middleman] server on
port 4567. You can access the rendered documentation by browsing to _http://<IP-of-Docker-daemon>:4567_.

If you encounter issues with the local staging of the documentation, you can run the following
command to delete the *_build_* sub-folder and the variables file:

----
$ make clean_docs
----

[[deploying-docs]]
== Deploying the documentation

The Minishift documentation is deployed on _docs.openshift.org_ under
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift[https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift].

To integrate with the _docs.openshift.org_ we deliver a tarball containing
the Minishift AsciiDoc files as well as some link:http://www.asciibinder.org/[AsciiBinder]
meta data.

This tarball can be built using:

----
$ make gen_adoc_tar
----

After the build completes there will be a *_minishift-adoc.tar_* file in the *_docs/build_* directory
of your local repository.

[[building-openshift-docs]]
=== Building OpenShift documentation

Before you start, you need to check out the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs.git[openshift-docs]
GitHub repository. You need all the tooling to build openshift-docs. See the
link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/tools_and_setup.adoc[Install and set up the tools and software] section,
which is part of the _openshift-docs_ repository.

After you successfully run `rake build` in your local repository, you can integrate the
Minishift documentation.

After you build the Minishift documentation tarball, follow these steps from the directory of
your local openshift-docs repository:

----
$ mkdir minishift
$ cd minishift
$ cp <path to tarball> .
$ tar -xvf minishift-adoc.tar --strip 1
$ cat _topic_map.yml >> ../_topic_map.yml
$ cd ..
$ rake build
----

If the build completes successfully, the site is available under *_preview/openshift-origin/latest/welcome/index.html_*.

OpenShift runs a nightly build in which they update the documentation. After you update the documentation,
you must wait for the nightly build that runs at midnight EST daily to view the documentation on _docs.openshift.org_.
