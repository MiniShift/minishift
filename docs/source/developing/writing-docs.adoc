== Overview

This section contains information about contributing to the Minishift documentation.

[[section-building-minishift-docs]]
== Building Minishift documentation

Minishift documentation is located in the `docs` sub-folder. The
documentation is a mix of generated
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] files and manually
maintained https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[Asciidoc] files.

If you are adding a new file to the doumentation please update
 the `_topic_map.yml`  in the root of `docs/source` sub-folder.

Per default the documentation is built in a Docker container. This way
you avoid having to install all the required dependencies on your
development machine. All you need is a running Docker daemon. In case
you don't have one, use Minishift itself. For further information refer to
link:../command-ref/minishift_docker-env{outfilesuffix}[`minishift docker-env`].

To build the Docker image, run:

[source,sh]
----
$ make build_docs_container
----

To generate the documentation into the directory `docs/build`, run:

[source,sh]
----
$ make gen_docs
----

To build and serve the documentation for editing, run:

[source,sh]
----
$ make serve_docs
----

The latter will start the https://middlemanapp.com[Middleman] server on
port 4567. You can access the rendered documentation by browsing to
http://<IP of Docker daemon>:4567.

== Deploying Minishift documentation

The Minishift documentation is deployed on _docs.openshift.org_ under
link:https://docs.openshift.org/minishift[https://docs.openshift.org/minishift].

To integrate with the _docs.openshift.org_ we deliver a tarball containing
the Minishift asciidoc files as well as some link:http://www.asciibinder.org/[AsciiBinder]
meta data.

This tarball can be built using:

[source,sh]
----
$ make gen_adoc_tar
----

Once the build completes there will be a _minishift-adoc.tar_ in the _docs/build_ directory
of your checkout.

How this tarball is integrated into the docs.openshift.org site build is described in
<<section-building-openshift-docs>>.

[[section-building-openshift-docs]]
=== Building OpenShift documentation

To start with you need a checkout of the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs.git[openshift-docs]
GitHub repository. You need all the tooling to build openshift-docs. Refer to
link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/blob/master/contributing_to_docs/tools_and_setup.adoc[Install and set up the tools and software] which is part of the openshift-docs repository.

Once you can successfully run `rake build` in your openshift-docs checkout, you can integrate the
Minishift documentation.

Start with building the documentation tarball as described in <<section-deploying-minishift-docs>>,
then follow these steps (assuming you are in the directory of your openshift-docs checkout):

[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir minishift
$ cd minishift
$ cp <path to tarball> .
$ tar -xvf minishift-adoc.tar --strip 1
$ cat _topic_map.yml >> ../_topic_map.yml
$ cd ..
$ rake build
----

If the build completes successfully, the site is available under _preview/openshift-origin/latest/welcome/index.html_.
