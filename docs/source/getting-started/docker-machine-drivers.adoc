Minishift uses Docker Machine and its driver plugin architecture to
provide a consistent way to manage the OpenShift VM. Minishift embeds
VirtualBox and VMware Fusion drivers so no additional steps are required to use them.

However, other drivers require manual installation steps that are
described in the following sections.

[[kvm-driver-install]]
== KVM driver

Minishift is currently tested against `docker-machine-driver-kvm` version 0.7.0.

Install and execute the KVM binary as follows:

----
$ sudo curl -L https://github.com/dhiltgen/docker-machine-kvm/releases/download/v0.7.0/docker-machine-driver-kvm -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kvm
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kvm
----

For more information, see the GitHub documentation of the https://github.com/dhiltgen/docker-machine-kvm#quick-start-instructions[docker machine KVM driver].

[[kvm-driver-debian]]
=== On Debian/Ubuntu

.  Install `libvirt` and `qemu-kvm` on your system:
+
----
$ sudo apt install libvirt-bin qemu-kvm
----

.  Add yourself to the **libvirtd** group (this may vary according to the Linux
distribution) so that you do not need to use `sudo`:
+
----
$ sudo usermod -a -G libvirtd <username>
----

.  Update your current session to apply the group change:
+
----
$ newgrp libvirtd
----

[[kvm-driver-fedora]]
=== On Fedora

.  Install `libvirt` and `qemu-kvm` on your system:
+
----
$ sudo dnf install libvirt qemu-kvm
----

.  Add yourself to the **libvirt** group so that you do not need to use `sudo`:
+
----
$ sudo usermod -a -G libvirt <username>
----

.  Update your current session to apply the group change:
+
----
$ newgrp libvirt

[[xhyve-driver-install]]
== xhyve driver

Minishift is currently tested against `docker-machine-driver-xhyve` version 0.3.1.

[[homebrew-install]]
=== Homebrew install

You can verify the installed version of the xhyve driver on your system before you install.

----
$ brew info --installed docker-machine-driver-xhyve
docker-machine-driver-xhyve: stable 0.3.1 (bottled), HEAD
Docker Machine driver for xhyve
https://github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
/usr/local/Cellar/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/0.3.1 (3 files, 13.2M) *
  Poured from bottle on 2016-12-20 at 17:44:35
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/docker-machine-driver-xhyve.rb
----

To install the latest version of the driver with brew:

----
$ brew install docker-machine-driver-xhyve

# docker-machine-driver-xhyve need root owner and uid
$ sudo chown root:wheel $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
$ sudo chmod u+s $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
----

For more information, see the GitHub documentation of the https://github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve#install[xhyve driver].

[[manual-install]]
=== Manual install

To manually install the xhyve driver, run the following commands:

----
$ go get -u -d github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/zchee/docker-machine-driver-xhyve

# Install docker-machine-driver-xhyve binary into /usr/local/bin
$ make install

# docker-machine-driver-xhyve need root owner and uid
$ sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
$ sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
