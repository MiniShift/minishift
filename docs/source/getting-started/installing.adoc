[[installing-overview]]
== Overview

The following section describes how to install Minishift and the required dependencies.

[[install-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Minishift requires a hypervisor to start the virtual machine on which the OpenShift cluster
is provisioned. Make sure that the hypervisor of your choice is installed and enabled on
your system before you start Minishift.

Depending on your host OS, you have the choice of the following
hypervisors:

Mac OS X::
- https://github.com/mist64/xhyve[xhyve] (default)
- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox]
- https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion[VMware Fusion]
+
NOTE: xhyve requires specific installation and configuration steps that are described
in the link:../getting-started/docker-machine-drivers{outfilesuffix}[Installing Docker machine drivers] section.

GNU/Linux::
- https://minishift.io/docs/docker-machine-drivers.html#kvm-driver[KVM] (default)
- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox]
+
NOTE: KVM requires specific installation and configuration steps that are described
in the link:../getting-started/docker-machine-drivers{outfilesuffix}[Installing Docker machine drivers] section.

Windows::
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v[Hyper-V] (default)
+
[NOTE]
====
- To use Minishift with Hyper-V ensure that, after you
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v[install Hyper-V], you also
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/quick_start/walkthrough_virtual_switch[add a Virtual Switch]
using the Hyper-V Manager.
- Make sure that you pair the virtual switch
with a __network card (wired or wireless) that is connected to the network__.
- If you have multiple virtual switches , set the environment variable `HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH` to the name of the external virtual switch you want to use for Minishift. For further information see
link:../using/managing-minishift{outfilesuffix}#driver-specific-environment-variables[setting driver specific environment variables].
====

- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox]
+
NOTE: It is recommended to use `Virtualbox 5.1.12` or later on Windows to avoid the issue
link:../using/troubleshooting{outfilesuffix}#machine-doesnt-exist[Error: machine does not exist].

If you encounter issues related to the hypervisor, see
the link:../using/troubleshooting{outfilesuffix}[Troubleshooting] section.

[[installing-instructions]]
== Installing Minishift

[[manual-install]]
=== Manually

.  Download the archive for your operating system from the https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases[Minishift releases page]
and unpack it.
.  Copy the contents of the directory to your preferred location.
.  Add the `minishift` binary to your _PATH_ environment variable.

[NOTE]
====
- On Windows operating system, due to issue
https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/236[#236], you need to
execute the minishift binary from the drive containing your `%USERPROFILE%` directory.
- Automatic update of the Minishift binary and the virtual machine ISO
is currently disabled. See also issue
https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/204[#204]
====

[[homebrew-install]]
=== With Homebrew

[[homebrew-stable-install]]
==== Stable

On OS X you can also use https://caskroom.github.io[Homebrew Cask] to
install the stable version of Minishift:

----
  $ brew cask install minishift
----

[[homebrew-latest-install]]
==== Latest Beta

If you want to install the latest beta version of Minishift you will
need the homebrew-cask versions tap. After you install `homebrew-cask`,
run the following command:

----
  $ brew tap caskroom/versions
----

You can now install the latest beta version of Minishift.

----
  $ brew cask install minishift-beta
----

[[uninstall-instructions]]
== Uninstalling Minishift

.  Delete the Minishift VM and any VM-specific files.
+
----
$ minishift delete
----
+
This command deletes everything in the
`MINISHIFT_HOME/.minishift/machines/minishift` directory. Other cached data and
the link:../using/managing-minishift{outfilesuffix}#persistent-configuration[persistent configuration] are not removed.

.  To completely uninstall Minishift, delete everything in the
`MINISHIFT_HOME` directory (default `~/.minishift`) and `~/.kube`:
+
----
$ rm -rf ~/.minishift
$ rm -rf ~/.kube
----

.  With your hypervisor management tool, confirm that there are no
remaining artifacts related to the Minishift VM. For example, if you use
KVM, you need to run the `virsh` command.
