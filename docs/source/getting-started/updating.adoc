== Updating Minishift

Update the Minishift binary as follows:

----
$ minishift update
----

This command checks whether there is a newer version of Minishift available.
If so, it prompts user to confirm the update, downloads the new binary and replaces the current version of Minishift.

NOTE: It is recommended to run the `minishift update` command after the xref:../command-ref/minishift_delete.adoc#minishift-delete[`minishift delete`] to avoid backward compatibility issues.
