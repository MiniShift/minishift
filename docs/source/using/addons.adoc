[[addons-overview]]
== Overview

NOTE: This feature is still considered experimental and might change in future releases.

Minishift allows to configure the vanilla OpenShift setup provided by _cluster up_ with an add-on mechanism.

Add-ons are directories that contain one or more text files with the _addon_ extension. The directory can also
have other resource files such as JSON template files. However, only one _addon_ file is allowed.

[[example-anyuid-addon]]
.Example: anyuid add-on definition file

This example shows the contents of the add-on text file, including the name and description of the add-on,
additional metadata, and the actual commands to run.

----
# Name: anyuid // <1>
# Description: Allows authenticated users to run images under a non pre-allocated UID // <2>
# Url: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_enterprise/3.2/html/cluster_administration/admin-guide-manage-scc <3>

oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated <4>
----
<1> (Required) Name of the add-on.
<2> (Required) Description of the add-on.
<3> Additional metadata and comments that are ignored by Minishift.
<4> Actual add-on command. In this case, the command executes the _oc_ binary. For the full
list of the supported add-on commands, see the <<section-addon-commands>>.

NOTE: Comment lines can be inserted at anywhere in the file. Comment lines must start with the '#' character.

Enabled add-ons (see <<section-enabling-disabling-addons>>) are be applied during
link:../command-ref/minishift_start{outfilesuffix}[`minishift start`], immediately after the initial
cluster provisioning is successfully completed.

[[addon-commands]]
== Add-on commands

This section describes the command types that an add-on file can contain and what the commands do.
The following command types are available, which form a sort of mini-DSL for add-ons:

ssh::
If the add-on command starts with _ssh_, you can run any command within the Minishift-managed VM.
This is similar to running link:../command-ref/minishift_ssh{outfilesuffix}[`minishift ssh`] and
then executing any command on the VM.

oc::
If the add-on command starts with _oc_, it uses the _oc_ binary that is cached on your host to execute
the specified `oc` command. This is similar to running `oc --as system:admin ...` from the command-line.
+
NOTE: The `oc` command is executed as _system:admin_

openshift::
If the add-on command starts with _openshift_, you can run the `openshift` binary within
the container that runs OpenShift. This means that any file parameters or other system-specific
parameters must match the environment of the container instead of your host.

docker::
If the add-on command starts with _docker_, it executes a `docker` command against the Docker daemon
within the Minishift VM. This is the same daemon on which the single-node OpenShift cluster is
running as well. This is similar to running `eval $(minishift docker-env)` on your host and
then executing any `docker` command. See also
link:../command-ref/minishift_docker-env{outfilesuffix}[`minishift docker-env`].

sleep::
If the add-on command starts with _sleep_, it waits for the specified number of seconds. This can be
useful in cases where you know that a command such as `oc` might take a few seconds before a certain
resource can be queried.

NOTE: Trying to add a command that is not listed will cause an error when the add-on gets parsed.

[[addon-variable-interpolation]]
=== Variable interpolation

Minishift also allows the use of variables as part of the supported commands.
Variables have the from _#{<variable-name>}_. <<example-addon-variable>>
shows how the routing suffix can be interpolated into a _openshift_ command
to create a new certificate as part of securing the OpenShift registry.

[[example-addon-routing-variable]]
.Example: Usage of the routing suffix variable

----
$ openshift admin ca create-server-cert \
  --signer-cert=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt \
  --signer-key=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.key \
  --signer-serial=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.serial.txt \
  --hostnames='docker-registry-default.#{routing-suffix},docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,172.30.1.1' \
  --cert=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
  --key=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----

<<table-supported-addon-variables>> shows the currently supported variables
which are available for interpolation.

[[table-supported-addon-variables]]
.Supported add-on variables
|===
|Variable |Description

|ip
|The IP of the Minishift VM

|routing-suffix
|The OpenShift routing suffix for application
|===

[[default-addons]]
== Default add-ons

Minishift provides a set of built-in add-ons that offer some common OpenShift customization
to assist with development. To install the default add-ons, run:

----
$ minishift addons install --defaults
----

This command extracts the default add-ons to the add-on installation directory
(`$MINISHIFT_HOME/addons`). To view the list of installed add-ons, you can then run:

----
$ minishift addons list --verbose=true
----

This command prints a list of installed add-ons. You should at least see the _anyuid_ add-on listed.
This is an important add-on that allows you to run images that do not use a pre-allocated UID.
By default, this is not allowed in OpensShift.

[[enabling-disabling-addons]]
== Enabling and disabling add-ons

Add-ons are enabled with the link:../command-ref/minishift_addons_enable{outfilesuffix}[`minishift addons enable`]
command and disabled with the link:../command-ref/minishift_addons_disable{outfilesuffix}[`minishift addons disable`] command.

The following examples show how to enable and disable the _anyuid_ add-on.

[[example-enable-anyuid]]
.Example: Enabling the anyuid add-on

----
$ minishift addons enable anyuid
----

[[example-disable-anyuid]]
.Example: Disabling the anyuid add-on

----
$ minishift addons disable anyuid
----

[[addon-priorities]]
=== Add-on priorities

When you enable an add-on, you can also specify a priority as seen in
<<example-enable-registry-priority>>.

[[example-enable-registry-priority]]
.Example: Enabling the registry add-on with priority

----
$ minishift addons enable registry --priority=5
----

The add-on priority attribute determines the order in which add-ons are applied.
By default, an add-on has the priority 0. Add-ons with a lower priority value are applied first.

[[example-priority-list]]
.Example: List command output with explicit priorities

----
$ minishift addons list
- anyuid         : enabled    P(0)
- registry       : enabled    P(5)
- eap            : enabled    P(10)
----

In <<example-priority-list>>, the _anyuid_, _registry_, and _eap_ add-ons are enabled with the respective
priorities of 0, 5 and 10. This means that _anyuid_ gets applied first, followed by _registry_, and lastly
the _eap_ add-on.

NOTE: If two add-ons have the same priority the order in which they are getting applied is not
determined.

[[custom-addons]]
== Writing custom add-ons

To write a custom add-on, you should create a directory and in it create at least one
text file with the extension _.addon_, for example `admin-role.addon`.

This file needs to contain the _Name_ and _Description_ metadata as well as the commands
that you want to execute as a part of the add-on. <<example-admin-role>> shows the the
definition of an add-on that gives the developer user cluster-admin privileges.

[[example-admin-role]]
.Example: Add-on definition for admin-role

----
# Name: admin-role
# Description: Gives the developer user cluster-admin privileges

oc adm policy add-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
----

After you define the add-on, you can install it by running:

----
$ minishift addons install <ADDON_DIR_PATH>
----

NOTE: You can also edit your add-on directly in the Minishift add-on install directory
`$MINISHIFT_HOME/addons`. Be aware that if there is an error in the add-on, it will not show
when you run any _addons_ commands and it will not be applied during the `minishift start` process.
