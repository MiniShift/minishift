[[overview]]
== Overview

NOTE: This feature is still considered experimental and might change in future releases.

Minishift allows to configure the vanilla OpenShift setup provided by *cluster up* with an add-on mechanism.

Add-ons are directories that contain one or more text files with the *_.addon_* extension.
The directory can also have other resource files such as JSON template files.
However, only one *_.addon_* file is allowed in each directory.

The following example shows the contents of the add-on text file, including the name and description of the add-on, additional metadata, and the actual commands to run.

[[example-anyuid-addon]]
.Example: anyuid add-on definition file

----
# Name: anyuid                                                                          // <1>
# Description: Allows authenticated users to run images under a non pre-allocated UID   // <2>

oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated                              // <3>
----
<1> (Required) Name of the add-on.
<2> (Required) Description of the add-on.
<3> Actual add-on command. In this case, the command executes the *oc* binary.

NOTE: Comment lines can be inserted at anywhere in the file. Comment lines must start with the '#' character.

Enabled add-ons are applied during xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`], immediately after the initial cluster provisioning is successfully completed.

[[addon-commands]]
== Add-on Commands

This section describes the command types that an add-on file can contain and what the commands do.
The following command types are available forming a sort of mini-DSL for add-ons:

ssh::
If the add-on command starts with `ssh`, you can run any command within the Minishift-managed VM.
This is similar to running xref:../command-ref/minishift_ssh.adoc#[`minishift ssh`] and then executing any command on the VM.
For more information about the `minishift ssh` command usage, see xref:../using/managing-minishift.adoc#connecting-with-ssh[Connecting to the Minishift VM with SSH].

oc::
If the add-on command starts with `oc`, it uses the *oc* binary that is cached on your host to execute the specified `oc` command.
This is similar to running `oc --as system:admin ...` from the command-line.
+
NOTE: The `oc` command is executed as *system:admin*.

openshift::
If the add-on command starts with `openshift`, you can run the *openshift* binary within the container that runs OpenShift.
This means that any file parameters or other system-specific parameters must match the environment of the container instead of your host.

docker::
If the add-on command starts with `docker`, it executes a `docker` command against the Docker daemon within the Minishift VM.
This is the same daemon on which the single-node OpenShift cluster is running as well.
This is similar to running `eval $(minishift docker-env)` on your host and then executing any `docker` command.
See also xref:../command-ref/minishift_docker-env.adoc#[`minishift docker-env`].

echo::
If the add-on command starts with `echo`, the arguments following the `echo` command are printed to the console.
This can be used to provide additional feedback during add-on execution.

sleep::
If the add-on command starts with `sleep`, it waits for the specified number of seconds.
This can be useful in cases where you know that a command such as `oc` might take a few seconds before a certain resource can be queried.

NOTE: Trying to add a command that is not listed will cause an error when the add-on gets parsed.

[[addon-variable-interpolation]]
=== Variable Interpolation

Minishift also allows the use of variables as part of the supported commands.
Variables have the format `#{<variable-name>}`.

The following example shows how the routing suffix can be interpolated into an `openshift` command to create a new certificate as part of securing the OpenShift registry.

[[example-addon-routing-variable]]
.Example: Usage of the routing suffix variable

----
$ openshift admin ca create-server-cert \
  --signer-cert=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.crt \
  --signer-key=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.key \
  --signer-serial=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.config/master/ca.serial.txt \
  --hostnames='docker-registry-default.#{routing-suffix},docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,172.30.1.1' \
  --cert=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
  --key=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----

The following table shows the supported variables that are available for interpolation.

[[table-supported-addon-variables]]
.Supported add-on variables

|===
|Variable |Description

|ip
|IP of the Minishift VM.

|routing-suffix
|OpenShift routing suffix for the application.

|addon-name
|Name of the current add-on.
|===

[[default-addons]]
== Default Add-ons

Minishift provides a set of built-in add-ons that offer some common OpenShift customization to assist with development.
To install the default add-ons, run:

----
$ minishift addons install --defaults
----

This command extracts the default add-ons to the add-on installation directory *_$MINISHIFT_HOME/addons_*.
To view the list of installed add-ons, you can then run:

----
$ minishift addons list --verbose=true
----

This command prints a list of installed add-ons. You should at least see the *anyuid* add-on listed.
This is an important add-on that allows you to run images that do not use a pre-allocated UID.
By default, this is not allowed in OpenShift.

[[enabling-disabling-addons]]
== Enabling and Disabling Add-ons

Add-ons are enabled with the xref:../command-ref/minishift_addons_enable.adoc#[`minishift addons enable`] command and disabled with the xref:../command-ref/minishift_addons_disable.adoc#[`minishift addons disable`] command.
Enabled add-ons automatically get executed during xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`].

The following examples show how to enable and disable the *anyuid* add-on.

[[example-enable-anyuid]]
.Example: Enabling the anyuid add-on

----
$ minishift addons enable anyuid
----

[[example-disable-anyuid]]
.Example: Disabling the anyuid add-on

----
$ minishift addons disable anyuid
----

[[addon-priorities]]
=== Add-on Priorities

When you enable an add-on, you can also specify a priority, which determines the order that the add-ons are applied.

The following example shows how to enable the *registry* add-on with a higher priority value.

[[example-enable-registry-priority]]
.Example: Enabling the registry add-on with priority

----
$ minishift addons enable registry --priority=5
----

The add-on priority attribute determines the order in which add-ons are applied.
By default, an add-on has the priority 0. Add-ons with a lower priority value are applied first.

In the following example, the *anyuid*, *registry*, and *eap* add-ons are enabled with the respective priorities of 0, 5 and 10.
This means that *anyuid* is applied first, followed by *registry*, and lastly the *eap* add-on.

[[example-priority-list]]
.Example: List command output with explicit priorities

----
$ minishift addons list
- anyuid         : enabled    P(0)
- registry       : enabled    P(5)
- eap            : enabled    P(10)
----

NOTE: If two add-ons have the same priority the order in which they are getting applied is not determined.

[[apply-addons]]
== Applying Add-ons

Add-ons can be explicitly executed with the xref:../command-ref/minishift_addons_apply.adoc#[`minishift addons apply`] command.
You can use the `apply` command for both enabled and disabled add-ons.
To apply multiple add-ons with a single command, specify add-on names separated by space.

The following example shows how to explicitly apply the *anyuid* and the *admin-user* add-ons.

[[example-apply-anyuid-admin-user]]
.Example: Applying anyuid and admin-user add-ons

----
$ minishift addons apply anyuid admin-user
----

[[custom-addons]]
== Writing Custom Add-ons

To write a custom add-on, you should create a directory and in it create at least one text file with the extension *_.addon_*, for example *_admin-role.addon_*.

This file needs to contain the *Name* and *Description* metadata fields, as well as the commands that you want to execute as a part of the add-on.

The following example shows the definition of an add-on that gives the developer user cluster-admin privileges.

[[example-admin-role]]
.Example: Add-on definition for admin-role

----
# Name: admin-role
# Description: Gives the developer user cluster-admin privileges

oc adm policy add-role-to-user cluster-admin developer
----

After you define the add-on, you can install it by running:

----
$ minishift addons install <ADDON_DIR_PATH>
----

NOTE: You can also edit your add-on directly in the Minishift add-on install directory *_$MINISHIFT_HOME/addons_*.
Be aware that if there is an error in the add-on, it will not show when you run any `addons` commands, and it will not be applied during the `minishift start` process.
