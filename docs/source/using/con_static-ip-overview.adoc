Most hypervisors do not support extending the lease time when the IP is assigned using DHCP.
This might lead to a new IP being assigned to the VM after a restart as it will conflict with the security certificates generated for the old IP.
This will make {project} completely unusable until a new instance is set up by running `minishift delete` followed by `minishift start`.

To prevent this, {project} includes the functionality to set a static IP address to the VM.
This will prevent the IP address from changing between restarts.
However, it will not work on all of the driver plug-ins at the moment due to the way the IP address is resolved.
