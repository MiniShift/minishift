[[experimental-features-overview]]
== Overview

If you want to get early access to some upcoming features and experiment, you can set the environment variable `MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL`, which makes additional feature flags available:

----
$ export MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=y
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Experimental features are not officially supported, and might break or result in unexpected behavior.
To share your feedback on these features, you are welcome to link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift#community[contact the {project} community].

[[enabling-experimental-oc-flags]]
== Enabling Experimental `oc cluster up` Flags

By default, {project} does not expose all link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/release-3.11/docs/cluster_up_down.md[`oc cluster up`] flags in the {project} CLI.

You can set the `MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL` environment variable to enable the following options for the xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`] command:

`extra-clusterup-flags`::
Enables passing flags directly to `oc cluster up` that are not directly exposed in the {project} CLI.

Using the experimental flag, to enable the Service Catalog in OKD 3.10 or in later versions, the command is:

----
$ MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=y minishift start --extra-clusterup-flags "--enable=*,service-catalog"
----

[NOTE]
====
The recommended way to enable service catalog is xref:../command-ref/minishift_openshift_component_add.adoc#[`minishift openshift component add`] command.
====

[[local-proxy-server]]
== Local Proxy Server

To help in the situation when  security certificates are used in the organization, but can not easily be shared with the instance, {project} can run a local proxy server on the host, which the {project} instance can use to access external resources.

Enabling the proxy server is done using the following command:

----
$ minishift config set local-proxy true
----

This will start a proxy server on the host which will be automatically assigned to the {project} instance.

When the corporate or upstream proxy is known, you can specify this with the following configuration option:

----
$ minishift config set local-proxy-upstream http(s)://[username:password@]host:port
----

When this option is used, all traffic will be re-encrypted with a {project} specific certificate.
For this reason, this proxy should only be used for development and use with {project}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To allow external traffic to your local host you might have to enable port `3128/tcp` in your host firewall.
====

[[local-dns-server]]
== Local DNS Server

{project} provides a DNS server for offline usage or the possibility of overriding DNS records while testing.
This will allow you to access the OpenShift routes without Internet.

[NOTE]
====
The DNS server is specific to a profile.
====

Starting the DNS server can be done as follows:

----
$ minishift dns start
----

After starting the DNS server you need to configure your device settings to use this nameserver. The start command will show you a temporary option that can be used when you entered offline usage.

[NOTE]
====
In the current implementation you need to start the server and do required changes in the host settings manually.
The DNS configuration is not permanent and might reset when the network state of the device changes.
====

Stopping the DNS server can be done as follows:

----
$ minishift dns stop
----

To get the status of the DNS server:

----
$ minishift dns status
----

[[local-dns-setup-macos]]
=== Local DNS Setup for macOS

Recent versions of macOS do not send out DNS queries in offline mode, and the process for using a local DNS server from {project} is more involved than other operating systems.

==== Enable tap devices

Check for the presence of `tap` devices in *_/dev_*:

----
$ ls /dev | grep tap
----

If no `tap` devices are present, install the *tuntap* package:

----
$ brew install tuntap
----

==== Use a tap device to create a network service

As root, open the *_/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist_* file and add the following XML under the `<key>NetworkServices</key>` element:

[source, xml]

<1> This is the UUID for the network service. Replace this value with the output of `uuidgen`.
<2> The IP address for the network service.
<3> The `/dev/tap` device to use.
<4> Name for the network service (This will appear in the Network Preferences GUI).

==== Adding the Network Service to _ServiceOrder_ array

In the *_/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist_* file, look for the `<key>ServiceOrder</key>` element.
As root, append the UUID for our *MiniTap* network service to this array.

<1> The UUID for *MiniTap* network service.

==== Adding the Network Service to _Service_ dictionary

In the *_/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist_* file, look for the `<key>Service</key>` element.
As root, append the following XML to its dictionary:

[source, xml]
----

        </dict>
    </dict>
----

<1> The UUID of the *MiniTap* service.
<2> Replace this UUID with the UUID of your *MiniTap* service.

Reboot macOS and you should see a *MiniTap* service in the Network Preferences GUI.
This service will be disconnected.
To turn it on, issue the following commands:

----
$ exec 4<>/dev/tap0			<!--1-->
$ ifconfig tap0 10.10.90.1 255.255.0.0  <!--1--> <!--2-->
$ ifconfig tap0 up			<!--1-->
----

<1> Replace it with the `/dev/tap` device used by *MiniTap* Service.
<2> IP address should be same as the one in the *MiniTap* Service definition.

==== Adding resolver config

Create the file `/etc/resolver/nip.io` with the following content:

----
nameserver <ip_address_of_the_minishfit_vm>
search_order 1
----

[[systemtray]]
== Minishift Systemtray

To help the users of {project} on macOS and Windows perform simple tasks like starting and stoppping a profile from the GUI, the binaries for these platforms
can be compiled to include an experimental systemtray. Follow the xref:../contributing/developing.adoc#[Developing Minishift] guide to setup your development
environment.

To build {project} with systemtray use the following command:

----
$ make systemtray
----

By default systemtray is automatically started on running xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`]. To disable the auto start behaviour use
the following command:

----
$ minishift config set auto-start-tray false
----

[[timezone]]
== Timezone Setup

If you want to set a different timezone from the default one, use the following command:

----
$ minishift timezone --set <Valid_Timezome>
----

To check the available timezone, use the following command:

----
$ minishift timezone --list
----

To check current timezone of {project} instance, use the following command:

----
$ minishift timezone
----
