[[experimental-features-overview]]
== Overview

If you want to get early access to some upcoming features and experiment, you can set the environment variable `MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL`, which makes additional features flags available:

----
$ export MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=y
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Experimental features are not officially supported, and might break or result in unexpected behavior.
To share your feedback on these features, you are welcome to link:https://github.com/minishift/minishift#community[contact the {project} community].

[[enabling-experimental-oc-flags]]
== Enabling experimental `oc cluster up` flags

By default, {project} does not expose all link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[`oc cluster up`] flags in the {project} CLI.

You can set the `MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL` environment variable to enable the following options for the xref:../command-ref/minishift_start.adoc#[`minishift start`] command:

`service-catalog`::
Enables provisioning the OpenShift link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/service_catalog/index.html[service catalog].

`extra-clusterup-flags`::
Enables passing flags that are not directly exposed in the {project} CLI directly to `oc cluster up`.

[[hyperv-static-ip]]
== Assign IP address to Hyper-V

Since the Internal Virtual Switch for Hyper-V does not provide a DHCP offer option, an IP address needs to be provided in a different way.
For Hyper-V a functionality is provided to assign an IP address on startup using the Data Exchange Service.

[IMPORTANT]
====
-  While the default image is B2D, this only works with the CentOS/RHEL based image in combination with Hyper-V. The B2D image experiences
   a problem when the values are being send to the {project} instance and consumed by the B2D iso. We are looking into the issue and hope
   to provide a solution in the coming future.

To make this work you need to create a link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/setup-nat-network[Virtual Switch using NAT]

[NOTE]
====
WinNAT is limited to one NAT network per host. For more details about capabilities, and limitations, please see the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/setup-nat-network[WinNAT capabilities and limitations blog]
====

The following command will attempt to assign an IP address for use on the Internal Virtual Switch 'MyInternal':

----
PS> $env:MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL="y"
PS> $env:HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH="MyInternal"
PS> minishift.exe start `
  --iso-url centos `
  --network-ipaddress 192.168.1.10 `
  --network-gateway 192.168.1.1 `
  --network-nameserver 8.8.8.8
----

If you want to use the 'DockerNAT' network, the following commands are needed to setup the correct NAT networking and assigning an IP in the range expected:

----
PS> New-NetNat -Name SharedNAT -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 10.0.75.1/24
PS> $env:MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL="y"
PS> $env:HYPERV_VIRTUAL_SWITCH="DockerNAT"
PS> minishift.exe start `
  --iso-url centos `
  --network-ipaddress 10.0.75.128 `
  --network-gateway 10.0.75.1 `
  --network-nameserver 8.8.8.8
----

[NOTE]
====
- Be sure to specify a valid gateway and nameserver. Failing to do so will result in connectivity issues
