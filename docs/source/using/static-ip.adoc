[[static-ip-overview]]
== Overview

Most hypervisors do not support extending the lease time when the IP is assigned using DHCP.
This might lead to a new IP being assigned to the VM after a restart as it will conflict with the security certificates generated for the old IP.
This will make {project} completely unusable until a new instance is set up by running `minishift delete` followed by `minishift start`.

To prevent this, {project} includes the functionality to set a static IP address to the VM.
This will prevent the IP address from changing between restarts.
However, it will not work on all of the driver plug-ins at the moment due to the way the IP address is resolved.

[NOTE]
====
- Assigning a static IP address to the {project} VM is only officially supported for Hyper-V.
- The {project} VM cannot be assigned a static IP address when using the KVM driver plug-in.

[[static-ip-hyperv]]
== Assign IP Address to Hyper-V

Since the Internal Virtual Switch for Hyper-V does not provide a DHCP offer option, an IP address needs to be provided in a different way.
Functionality is provided to assign an IP address on startup using the Data Exchange Service for Hyper-V.

to make this work, you need to create a link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/setup-nat-network[Virtual Switch using NAT].

[NOTE]
====
WinNAT is limited to one NAT network per host.
For more details about capabilities and limitations, please see the link:https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2016/05/25/windows-nat-winnat-capabilities-and-limitations/[WinNAT capabilities and limitations blog].
====

The following command will attempt to assign an IP address for use on the Internal Virtual Switch 'MyInternal':

----
PS> minishift.exe config set hyperv-virtual-switch "MyInternal"
PS> minishift.exe start `
  --network-ipaddress 192.168.1.10 `
  --network-gateway 192.168.1.1 `
  --network-nameserver 8.8.8.8
----

If you want to use the 'DockerNAT' network, the following commands are needed to setup the correct NAT networking and assign an IP in the range expected:

----
PS> New-NetNat -Name SharedNAT -InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 10.0.75.1/24
PS> minishift.exe config set hyperv-virtual-switch "DockerNAT"
PS> minishift.exe start `
  --network-ipaddress 10.0.75.128 `
  --network-gateway 10.0.75.1 `
  --network-nameserver 8.8.8.8
----

[NOTE]
====
Be sure to specify a valid gateway and nameserver.
Failing to do so will result in connectivity issues.

[[set-fixed-ip]]
== Set Fixed IP Address

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is not supported on KVM as the driver plug-in relies on the DHCP offer to determine the IP address.
====

The following command will set the IP address that was assigned as fixed:

----
$ minishift ip --set-static
----

If you prefer to use dynamic assignment, you can use:

----
$ minishift ip --set-dhcp
----

[NOTE]
====
Use `minishift config set static-ip false` to stop assign the static ip automatically for supported hypervsiors.
