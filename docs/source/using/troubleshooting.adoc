[[troubleshooting-overview]]
== Overview

This section contains solutions to common problems that you might
encounter while using Minishift.

[[troubleshooting-kvm]]
== KVM driver

[[dial-tcp-missing-address]]
=== Error creating new host: dial tcp: missing address

The problem is likely that the `libvirtd` service is not running. You can check this
with the following command:

----
$ systemctl status libvirtd
----

If `libvirtd` is not running, start it and enable it to start on boot:

----
$ systemctl start libvirtd
$ systemctl enable libvirtd
----

[[fail-connect-socket]]
=== Failed to connect socket to '/var/run/libvirt/virtlogd-sock'

The problem is likely that the `virtlogd` service is not running.
You can check this with the following command:

----
$ systemctl status virtlogd
----

If `virtlogd` is not running, start it and enable it to start on boot:

----
$ systemctl start virtlogd
$ systemctl enable virtlogd
----

[[domain-minishift-already-exists]]
=== Error starting the VM: ... operation failed: domain 'minishift' already exists ...

Check for existing VMs and remove them:

----
$ sudo virsh list --all
$ sudo virsh destroy minishift
$ sudo virsh undefine minishift
----

[[troubleshooting-xhyve]]
== xhyve driver

[[create-vmnet-interface-permission]]
=== Error: could not create vmnet interface, permission denied or no entitlement

The problem is likely that the xhyve driver is not able to clean
up `vmnet` when a VM is removed. `vmnet.framework` determines the IP address
based on the following files:

* _/var/db/dhcpd_leases_
* _/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.vmnet.plist_

Reset the `minishift`-specific IP database, make sure to remove the
`minishift` entry section from the `dhcpd_leases` file, and reboot your
system.

----
{
  ip_address=192.168.64.2
  hw_address=1,2:51:8:22:87:a6
  identifier=1,2:51:8:22:87:a6
  lease=0x585e6e70
  name=minishift
}
----

NOTE: You can completely reset the IP database by removing the files
manually but this is very *risky*.

[[troubleshooting-vbox]]
== VirtualBox driver

[[machine-doesnt-exist]]
=== Error: getting state for host: machine does not exist

If you use Windows, make sure that you set the `--vm-driver virtualbox`
flag in the `minishift start` command. Alternatively, the problem might be
an outdated version of VirtualBox.

To avoid this issue, it is recommended to use VirtualBox 5.1.12 or later.

[[troubleshooting-authentication]]
== Users and authentication

[[special-characters-passwords]]
=== Some special characters cause passwords to fail

Depending on your operating system and shell environment, certain
special characters can trigger variable interpolation and therefore
cause passwords to fail.

Workaround: When creating and entering passwords, wrap the string with
single quotes in the following format: `<password>`

[[troubleshooting-snapshots]]
== Snapshots with virsh

[[minishift-delete-fails-undefine-snapshots]]
=== `minishift delete` fails to undefine snapshots of running instances made using virsh on KVM/libvirt

If you use `virsh` on KVM/libvirt to create snapshots in your development
workflow, and then use `minishift delete` to delete the snapshots along with
the VM, you might encounter the following error:

----
$ minishift delete
Deleting the Minishift VM...
Error deleting the VM:  [Code-55] [Domain-10] Requested operation is not valid: cannot delete inactive domain with 4 snapshots
----

Cause: The snapshots are stored in `~/.minishift/machines`, but the
definitions are stored in `var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot/minishift`.

Workaround: To delete the snapshots you need to perform the following steps.

.  Delete the definitions.
+
----
$ sudo virsh snapshot-delete --metadata minishift <snapshot-name>
----

.  Undefine the Minishift domain.
+
----
$ sudo virsh undefine minishift
----

You can now run `minishft delete` to delete the VM and restart Minishift.

[NOTE]
====
In case the above steps do not resolve the issue, you can also
use the following command to delete the snapshots:

----
$ rm -rf ~/.minishift/machines
----
====

It is recommended to avoid using metadata when you create snapshots. To make sure of
this, you can specify the `--no-metadata` flat. For example:

----
$ sudo virsh snapshot-create-as --domain vm1 overlay1 --diskspec vda,file=/export/overlay1.qcow2 --disk-only --atomic --no-metadata
----
