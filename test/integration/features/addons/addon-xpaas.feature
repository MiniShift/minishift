@addon-xpaas
Feature: xpaas add-on
Xpaas add-on imports xPaaS templates and imagestreams,
which are then available in OpenShift to the user.

  Scenario: User enables the xpaas add-on
     When executing "minishift addons enable xpaas" succeeds
     Then stdout should contain "Add-on 'xpaas' enabled"

  Scenario: User starts Minishift
    Given Minishift has state "Does Not Exist"
      And image caching is disabled
     When executing "minishift start --memory 4GB" succeeds
     Then Minishift should have state "Running"
      And stdout should contain
      """
      XPaaS imagestream and templates for OpenShift installed
      """

  Scenario Outline: User deploys, checks out and deletes several templates from XpaaS imagestream
   Given Minishift has state "Running"
     And executing "oc status" retrying 20 times with wait period of "3s"
    When executing "oc new-project <project-name>" succeeds
     And executing "oc new-app <template-name>" succeeds
     And executing "oc set probe dc/<service-name> --readiness --get-url=http://:8080<http-endpoint>" succeeds
     And service "<service-name>" rollout successfully within "20m"
    Then with up to "5" retries with wait period of "1s" the "body" of HTTP request to "<http-endpoint>" of service "<service-name>" in namespace "<project-name>" contains "<expected-hello>"
     And with up to "5" retries with wait period of "1s" the "status code" of HTTP request to "<http-endpoint>" of service "<service-name>" in namespace "<project-name>" is equal to "200"
     And executing "oc delete project <project-name>" succeeds

  Examples: Required information to test the templates
    | project-name  | template-name           | service-name   | http-endpoint | expected-hello                        |
